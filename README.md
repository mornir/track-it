# ðŸ•“ Track it!

> Web extension to track time wasted on addictive websites

Are there websites that you wish you would visit less often? The web counts numerous addictive, unproductive, distractive websites. This web extension shows you the last time you visited such websites and encourages you to keep off of them.

## âœ¨ FEATURES

âœ” Choose the websites you want to track  
âœ” Show the collective last visit time  
âœ” Show the longest streak to keep you motivated  
âœ” Minimalist UI  
âœ” Privacy-focused  
âœ” Open-source

## ðŸ¤« PRIVACY

This extension only reads your local history and doesn't share it. The list of websites you track is only stored locally and is not sync with your Google/Firefox account.

## Calculation of the longest streak

The duration of longest streak is calculated between visits to exact URLs. For example, if you add `https://www.youtube.com`, but always access YouTube through `https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions` (e.g. via a bookmark), the later URL won't be taken into account.

Beware also of query parameters:
`https://www.youtube.com` and `https://www.youtube.com/?gl=CH` are considered as two different URL.

In Chrome, the longest streak is only recorded over the last three months, because Chrome doesn't keep browser history records that are older than three months.
In my opinion, this is not an issue, because if you can refrain from visiting an addictive website for more than three months, you already succeeded. ðŸ˜‰
